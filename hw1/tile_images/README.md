# Tile Images Directory

Place small images in this directory to use as mosaic tiles when using the "image_tiles" tile type.

## Supported formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- BMP
- TIFF

## Recommendations:
- Use small images (preferably square)
- Images will be automatically resized to 32x32 pixels
- Mix different types of images for varied effects (nature, textures, icons, etc.)
- More images = more variety in the mosaic

## Examples of good tile images:
- Flowers, leaves, stones
- Geometric shapes, icons
- Small texture samples
- Emoji or symbols
- Abstract patterns

The mosaic generator will randomly select from these images to create each tile, adjusting brightness to match the original image's local average color.
